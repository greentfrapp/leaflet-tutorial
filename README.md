# leaflet-tutorial

This is the accompanying repository to my Leaflet tutorial [here](https://greentfrapp.github.io/2018/10/06/leaflet-tutorial.html).

Just download this repository as a zip file (click the bright green "Clone or download" button above and then click "Download ZIP").

The HTML files can be opened as standalone files, just double-click to open with your default browser. The files also build on top of one another, in increasing complexity (ie. `2-multiple-layers.html` builds on top of `1-basic.html`).

You can also click on the following to view the HTML pages.
